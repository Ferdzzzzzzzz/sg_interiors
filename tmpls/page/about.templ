					<p>
						Hi, I’m Stephanie Grant, the face behind the designs and the heart behind the creativity at SG Interiors.
					</p>
					<p>
						SG Interiors offers residential and commercial interior design and decorating. We pride ourselves on adaptability - making each project work for the client's needs and budget.
					</p>
					<p>
						We can assist you with as much of the design journey as you would need us to. Whether it’s only requiring online consultations or full on-site visits and project management, we’re here to help.
					</p>
					<p>
						Creating spaces that feel like a timeless reflection of your personality is always my number one priority - this is a space that you must feel most comfortable.
					</p>
					<p>
						For me, interior design isn't just about aesthetics; it's about creating an environment each individual uniquely loves.
